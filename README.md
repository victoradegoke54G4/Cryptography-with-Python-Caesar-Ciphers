# 🔐 Cryptography with Python: Caesar Cipher

A simple Python project demonstrating the **Caesar Cipher**, one of the oldest forms of encryption — shifting letters in the alphabet by a chosen key.

---

## 🧠 Overview
This project is a beginner-friendly implementation of the **Caesar Cipher** in Python.  
It allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using a numeric shift value.  
Non-alphabet characters remain unchanged, making the program practical and readable.

---

## ✨ Features
- Encrypt and decrypt text using Caesar cipher logic  
- Preserves spaces, punctuation, and numbers  
- Simple command-line interface  
- Input validation for user entries  
- ASCII art logo for a fun touch

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/victoradegoke54G4/Cryptography-with-Python-Caesar-Ciphers.git
   cd Cryptography-with-Python-Caesar-Ciphers
    ````

2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. Follow the prompts:

   * Type **encode** to encrypt
   * Type **decode** to decrypt
   * Type **exit** to quit

## 🧮 Example

```
Type 'E' to encrypt, 'D' to decrypt:
> E
Enter your message:
> hello world
Enter shift number:
> 5
Your encoded text is: mjqqt btwqi
```
